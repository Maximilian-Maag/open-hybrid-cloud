/**
 * ESLint flat config, replacing `.eslintrc.json` driven by `next lint` — which is
 * deprecated in Next.js 15 and gone in 16 (issue #93).
 *
 * `eslint-config-next` is still eslintrc-shaped (it has no flat export at 15.5), so
 * `FlatCompat` is what translates `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript` into
 * flat entries. It goes when that package ships a flat config of its own.
 *
 * Both apps run `eslint . --max-warnings 0`, so every rule here is a gate on the
 * first PR that trips it. Each one below was switched on, counted against the tree,
 * and kept only where the count was zero or where every violation was worth fixing;
 * the ones that found a hundred edits and no defects were left off on purpose.
 * This file and its frontend/backend twin are kept identical.

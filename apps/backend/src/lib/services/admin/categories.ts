  /*
   * Count the orders and decide retire-vs-delete INSIDE the deleting
   * transaction, holding FOR UPDATE on the category's products (#195).
   *
   * This used to be decided in JS at the top of the function, before one destroy
   * trigger per active element — seconds to minutes of HTTP — and only then the
   * DELETE. A category whose products had never been ordered got `retire = false`
   * on the way in. A project manager placing an order during that window had it
   * cascaded away by the DELETE: categories -> products -> orders, taking
   * `product_snapshot` with it. No error, no audit trace, no recovery. Offerings
   * are withdrawn only inside the retire branch, so nothing stopped the order
   * being placeable.
   *
   * `deleteProduct` documents this same window one level down; this is the same
   * remedy one level up.
   *
   * TWO locks, because there are two races and each lock closes only one.
   *
   *   FOR UPDATE on the products closes "a new ORDER on a product that already
   *   exists": `orders` references `products`, so that is the row an order
   *   insert takes a KEY SHARE lock on.
   *
   *   FOR UPDATE on the CATEGORY row closes "a new PRODUCT in this category,
   *   and an order on it". A row lock cannot lock a row that does not exist
   *   yet, so the products query above is blind to it: the scan returns
   *   nothing, `orderCount` stays 0, and the DELETE cascades the new product
   *   and its order away. `products` references `categories`, so a product
   *   insert takes KEY SHARE on this row and FOR UPDATE conflicts with it.
   *
   * Parent first, then children — the same order every other path takes them
   * in, which is what keeps two concurrent deletes from deadlocking.

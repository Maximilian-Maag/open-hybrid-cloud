 * Grafana (#117).
 *
 * Three things here are the reason the issue exists rather than each of those
 * five discovering them separately:
 *
 * 1. The credential is encrypted at rest and NEVER leaves this module. There is
 *    no reveal endpoint and no `credential` field in any response shape; the one
 *    reader is `resolveIntegration`, which is for server-side consumers.
 * 2. `failureMode` is stored, not decided at the call site. Use
 *    `blocksProvisioning` rather than re-deciding.
 * 3. Every mutation is audited, and a credential change is audited a second time
 *    as a rotation — an operator asking "when was this token last changed" should
 *    not have to infer it from an `integration.updated` entry.

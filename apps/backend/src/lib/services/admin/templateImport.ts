 * Checked against the real `infra-templates` repository before this was settled.
 * Every one of its twelve templates is built out of modules AND declares its own
 * `variables.tf`, under the header "Product parameters (set by users when
 * ordering)" — the root passes each of them down explicitly. Descending anyway
 * added 17 more variables across those twelve: `tags`, `deletion_protection`,
 * `apply_immediately`, `ami_owner`, `user_data`, `windows_time_zone`. Every one
 * is a module knob the template author deliberately left at its default, and
 * every one would have arrived as a field on the order form.
 *
 * So: if the root declares any variables, they are the answer and the modules are
 * not read. A root that declares none is the case module traversal exists for,
 * and only then does it descend — a child variable is included only when the
 * caller has NOT already assigned it, because
 * `module "compute" { instance_type = var.instance_type }` means the root has
 * answered that one.
 *
 * Remote sources — the registry, `git::`, anything not a relative path — cannot
 * be read through the CI file API. They are reported in `skippedModules` rather
 * than passed over silently: a partial import that says it is partial is usable,
 * one that does not is a trap.

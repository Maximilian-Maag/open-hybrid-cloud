/**
 * Spending overview (issue #32).
 *
 * ── What counts as spend ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only orders that actually reached provisioning: 'provisioning' and 'completed'.
 * A rejected or pending order never cost anything, and counting it would inflate
 * every figure on the page. A 'failed' order is excluded too — its pipeline did not
 * deliver infrastructure — which means a retried order (issue #29) starts counting
 * again once it succeeds, not twice.
 *
 * ── Which price ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The price stored in the order's snapshot (issue #38), which is what the customer
 * was actually charged at the time. Falling back to the offering's CURRENT price
 * would silently restate history every time an admin edits a price — the exact
 * problem snapshots exist to prevent. Orders that predate snapshots have none, so
 * they fall back to the current price and are counted in `estimatedOrders` so the
 * total can be read with that in mind rather than presented as exact.
 *
 * ── Which cost centre an order counts against ─────────────────────────────────
 * The order's own `cost_center_id` where it has one — 'select' mode, where the
 * orderer chose it, and 'overhead' mode, where the offering fixed it. In 'project'
 * mode (the DEFAULT) the order deliberately stores none, because attribution
 * follows the project, so the project's cost centre is used instead. Reading only
 * the order-level column would file every default-mode order under "no cost
 * centre" and leave the per-cost-centre breakdown empty for most catalogues.
 *
 * ── What the figures are NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `product_environments.price` records an amount and a currency but no billing
 * period, so there is no honest way to derive a monthly run rate from it. These
 * are sums of the recorded price of each provisioned order in the window, not a
 * time-based projection. The UI says so.

 * the window the user picked. A weekly grain would straddle both edges of every

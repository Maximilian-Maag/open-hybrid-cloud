/**
 * Recording what the scheduled drift pipeline found (#108).
 *
 * The portal does not ask. A pipeline in `infra-templates` runs on GitLab's own
 * schedule, takes the work list from `driftTargets`, runs
 * `plan -refresh-only -detailed-exitcode` against each state file, and POSTs one
 * report.
 *
 * That inversion is what makes this small. The push design in #108 needed
 * refresh-specific pipeline tracking (`pipeline_id` is already two-phase-owned
 * by provisioning and teardown), a third match branch in the webhook handler (a
 * refreshing element stays 'active' and matches neither existing predicate),
 * and log scraping to recover `-detailed-exitcode` from a pipeline status that
 * only carries success or failed. None of that exists here because none of it
 * is needed.
 *
 * A report is UNTRUSTED INPUT. It arrives from CI over a shared secret, and the
 * rules below are the whole of what it may do:
 *
 *  - it may never create, delete or decommission an element;
 *  - it may only write the four refresh columns, and only on elements that are
 *    'active' — an element mid-teardown is not something a stale plan should
 *    annotate;
 *  - it may only move an element's refresh state FORWARD in time;
 *  - a state key it does not recognise is recorded as an observation and
 *    nothing else.

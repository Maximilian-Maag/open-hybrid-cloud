 *
 *  - The FAN-OUT is per element, not per order: each element gets its own
 *    pipeline run, because each is a separate piece of infrastructure that has to
 *    be retryable and tearable-down on its own ("decommission 3 of 20").
 *  - Each element therefore needs its own Terraform state, which is what
 *    ELEMENT_SEQUENCE is for: the trigger layer derives TF_STATE_NAME from it, so
 *    element 2 cannot apply on top of element 1's state. Element 1's key is
 *    unchanged from the pre-quantity behaviour, so existing infrastructure keeps
 *    working. See `elementStateSuffix`.
 *  - The ROW is created before its triggers fire, not after, so an element that
 *    fails to start is a visible element with no pipelines rather than a pipeline
 *    with no row.
 *  - The order's `pipelineId` is the union over its elements, which is what the
 *    callback handler matches events against and what makes "all pipelines
 *    succeeded" mean "every element provisioned".
 *
 * Shared by the admin's direct order and the approval path so the two cannot
 * drift; a second copy of the fan-out is a second set of state-key rules.
 *
 * Throws only if NOT ONE element could be started, which is the case both callers
 * already handle (they undo their claim). A partial failure records a sentinel in
 * the order's pipeline status instead, so the order can never report itself
 * complete while one of its elements was never triggered at all.

/**
 * Point-in-time capture of what a customer was actually offered (issue #38).
 *
 * Orders and infrastructure reference a product by id, so a later price change or
 * a removed parameter silently rewrites history: the order detail page would show
 * today's configuration as though it were the one that was approved. The snapshot
 * is what makes an order's own record of itself durable.
 *
 * Deliberately a denormalised JSON blob rather than a set of versioned rows. The
 * point is that it can never be changed by anything that happens to the catalogue
 * afterwards, and a foreign key into versioned tables would reintroduce exactly
 * that coupling. Migrating the shape is the price; it is the right one.

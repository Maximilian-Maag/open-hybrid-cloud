/**
 * The CI variables a teardown is fired with.
 *
 * One definition, because there are four callers — the Decommission button, the
 * scheduled sweep, product deletion and project deletion — and a teardown that
 * derives a different Terraform state key than its provisioning did destroys
 * nothing while reporting success. `sequence` is the part that makes that a real
 * risk now that one order has N elements (issue #104): it suffixes the state key,
 * so element 3 must be torn down with `3` and not with whatever its sibling used.
 *
 * `stateKeyNamespace` is required rather than optional for the same reason, and
 * deliberately unlike `sequence`: it is read straight off the row and a projection
 * that forgot to select it would silently read as NULL, which means "derive the
 * pre-#183 key" — and destroying the wrong state name destroys nothing while
 * reporting success. Required makes the compiler ask every caller.

 *
 * Both trigger kinds are fired: infrastructure provisioned by a pipeline stack
 * would otherwise never be torn down. Neither kind aborts on a single failure
 * (one broken stack must not block the rest of the teardown), so the caller has
 * to decide what a partial failure means for it — see `failures`.
 *
 * Three cases:
 *  - nothing failed → pipeline ids stored, teardown is trackable to completion
 *  - nothing STARTED → the element is untouched infrastructure, so it is handed
 *    back to 'active' and the caller can retry
 *  - partial → the started pipelines are stored, plus a sentinel entry per
 *    failed trigger. The sentinel matters: a failed trigger contributes no
 *    pipeline id, so without it the callback handler would flip the element to
 *    'decommissioned' as soon as the pipelines that DID start succeed —
 *    reporting a completed teardown while one stack was never destroyed.
 *
 * Every teardown path goes through here — the Decommission button, the sweep,
 * product deletion, project deletion, category deletion — which is why the id
 * bookkeeping lives here rather than in each of them. Ids are recorded one at a
 * time, as each destroy starts, because a destroy that fails in under a second
 * POSTs its callback before this function returns; matched against an element
 * that still listed its PROVISIONING ids, that callback found nothing and left
 * the element stranded in 'decommissioning' — a state both `claimAndDestroy` and
 * the sweep skip permanently (issue #132).

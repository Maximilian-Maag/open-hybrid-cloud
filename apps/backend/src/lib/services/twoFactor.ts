/**
 * Everything about the second factor: enrollment, verification, recovery codes,
 * the lockout, and the audit trail.
 *
 * The rules that matter, in one place so a reviewer can check them against the
 * issue without reading the routes:
 *
 *   0. Only a LOCAL administrative account — `root` or `admin`, signing in with a
 *      password — may enroll or hold a factor, and every one of them MUST (issue
 *      #197; #36 was root-only and opt-in). An SSO account is covered by its
 *      identity provider's MFA and is excluded from both halves.
 *      `loadTwoFactorAccount` is the single gate that enforces who may, and
 *      `secondFactorOutstanding` is the single answer to who still owes one. The
 *      one exception, spelled out at `requiresSecondFactor`, is the login check:
 *      a confirmed row is honoured whatever the role, so a demoted admin is asked
 *      for a code rather than quietly losing the protection or being locked out.
 *   1. A confirmed factor can never be switched off through the API. There is no
 *      `disable` function here, and nothing sets `secret` back to NULL. The only
 *      exits are a re-enrollment (which replaces it) and an operator deleting the
 *      row in the database — see docs/guides/root.md.
 *   2. Re-enrollment always costs a second factor: a current TOTP code, or a
 *      recovery code. Password alone is not enough, or a stolen session would be
 *      able to swap the factor out and lock the owner out of their own account.
 *   3. An accepted code's step is recorded, and anything at or below it is
 *      refused afterwards. A code is single-use, not "valid for 90 seconds".
 *   4. Failures are counted in the database and lock the factor. Six digits is a
 *      10^6 space; a few guesses per second gets through it in days.
 */

/**
 * Failures allowed before the second factor locks.
 *
 * Five, and then fifteen minutes. The arithmetic is the argument: 10^6 codes at
 * 5 per 15 minutes is 5.7 years of continuous guessing for a 50% chance, against
 * roughly two hours if the limit were 100 per 15 minutes. Five is also more than
 * a person mistypes in a row, so a legitimate user who fat-fingers a code twice
 * never meets it.
 *
 * The counter is CONSECUTIVE — a success clears it — so an occasional wrong code
 * over weeks of normal use never accumulates into a lockout.

 *      to `root` and `admin` and made it mandatory for both. `project_manager`
 *      stays out: it is the end-user role, and letting it enroll would send an
 *      ordinary user through a two-step login built for administrators.
 *
 * Order only decides what a caller is told when more than one rule applies: an
 * SSO admin hears about the SSO, which is the more useful of the two answers —
 * and it is why rule 2 sitting above rule 3 matters more since #197. An SSO
 * administrator is refused here, so `secondFactorOutstanding` must not require a
 * factor of them; a gate they could never satisfy is a lockout, not a policy.
 *

 *  - the callback handler, after merging a pipeline's success into the map;
 *  - the trigger fan-out, after it stops recording ids (see pipelineTracking).
 *
 * The second exists because the ids are now recorded one at a time, the instant
 * each trigger returns (issue #132). That closes the window in which a callback
 * could not find its row, and opens a smaller one: while the fan-out is still
 * running, the row lists only the pipelines started SO FAR, so a callback for the
 * first of them would see "every pipeline succeeded" and complete an order whose
 * remaining elements were never triggered. `TRIGGERING_KEY` holds that shut, and
 * whoever removes it has to re-ask the question the callback was not allowed to

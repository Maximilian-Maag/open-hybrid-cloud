   * the three that had drifted. Column by column it was:
   *
   *   * CHECK constraints on five tables that exist in no migration, so an
   *     out-of-range enum was REFUSED under test and stored happily in
   *     production — a test double stricter than the thing it stands in for,
   *     which is the wrong direction;
   *   * `callback_secret DEFAULT ''` and `rate DEFAULT 1`, neither of them real,

   *
   * And the cost of keeping it: every new column had to be added in two places,
   * which is how migration 0034 came to need a second edit here on the same day
   * it was written.
   *
   * Running the real files removes the copy AND buys something the copy never
   * could — the migrations are now exercised on every suite run, so one that
   * does not apply fails here rather than in a deployment.
   *
   * Idempotent by construction: the migrator reads `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`
   * and applies only what is missing, so the cost after the first file in a
   * worker is one SELECT. Each worker holds its own database under an advisory
   * lock (see `acquireTestDatabase`), so no two of them migrate the same one.

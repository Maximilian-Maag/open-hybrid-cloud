 * The precision caveats, repeated wherever a figure is drawn (issue #106).
 *
 * The total card has shown these since #32. A chart is where they matter more, not
 * less: a column per month looks exactly like a monthly run rate, and the catalogue
 * stores no billing period, so a trend drawn from these numbers is a trend of
 * recorded order prices and nothing else. Estimated and unconverted amounts move
 * the columns without appearing in them.
 *
 * Duplicated deliberately rather than printed once at the top of the page: a card
 * can be read, screenshotted or scrolled to on its own, and a caveat that is not
 * attached to the figure is a caveat nobody sees.

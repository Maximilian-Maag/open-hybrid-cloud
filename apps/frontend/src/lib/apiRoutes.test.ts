/**
 * The reverse proxy has to know which /api paths are NOT the backend's.
 *
 * Both apps are Next.js and both serve routes under /api. The proxy splits them
 * by path, which means the split is a hand-maintained copy of a fact that lives
 * in the frontend's file tree — and #196 is what happens when the copy falls
 * behind: #36 added `/api/login-challenge` to the frontend, neither proxy config
 * learned about it, and every sign-in on the deployed instance got a 404 from
 * the backend. It carried the backend's CORS headers, which is how it was
 * finally attributed.
 *
 * So: derive the list from the frontend build, and fail if either config is
 * missing one. This is the gate that #196 did not have.
 *
 * Both configs are checked, because they are deployed independently and were
 * wrong in DIFFERENT ways — the Helm ingress sent all of /api to the backend
 * including NextAuth, while nginx.conf.example had already special-cased
 * /api/auth/ and only missed the two routes added after it was written.

/**
 * When the backend session dies, and how everything finds out.
 *
 * Two clocks used to run independently: the NextAuth cookie (30 days by default)
 * and the backend JWT it carries as `apiToken` (24 h, see the backend's
 * `lib/auth/jwt.ts`). For the 29 days in between, the cookie said "signed in"
 * while every API call came back 401 — a page that looks logged in, holds no
 * data, and explains nothing (issue #103).
 *
 * #103 pinned the two together with one shared constant. #37 took that constant
 * away: a session's lifetime is now a per-session decision — 8 h normally, 30 days
 * with "remember me" — so no single number can describe every session, and a
 * session can also end early because someone revoked it.
 *
 * What replaces the shared constant is stricter, not looser:
 *
 *  - `SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` sizes the cookie to the longest session the
 *    backend will ever issue. It is a ceiling, not a promise.
 *  - The exact end of *this* session travels on the session itself, as the
 *    token's own `exp` (`apiTokenExp`), and the middleware and the dashboard
 *    layout refuse to render past it. That is per-session and exact, which the
 *    shared constant never was.
 *  - Anything that ends a session early — a revoked session (#37), a rotated
 *    signing secret, clock skew — shows up as a 401, and `lib/api.ts` turns a 401
 *    into a sign-out and a trip to `/login?expired=1`.
 *
 * So the failure mode #103 fixed cannot return: the cookie outliving a short
 * session is exactly the case `isApiTokenExpired` is checked for on every
 * request.

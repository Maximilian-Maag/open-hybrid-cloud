# Codebase Audit — 2026-08-12

Full audit of the monorepo (backend Next.js API, frontend, shared types, infra).
Baseline before changes: typecheck ✅, lint ✅, 719 backend + 20 frontend tests ✅.
After changes: typecheck ✅, lint ✅, **722 backend + 20 frontend tests ✅**.

The fixes below are applied on this branch. The "Deferred" section lists confirmed
findings that need a product/architecture decision or cannot be safely verified
without a live external system (GitHub/Entra), and so were intentionally not
changed blind.

---

## Fixed on this branch

### Security

1. **GitHub & Bitbucket callbacks verified the wrong secret** — both routes
   computed the inbound HMAC against `webhook_token` (the *outbound* trigger
   token) instead of `callback_secret`. GitLab was already migrated (0004).
   The moment an operator rotates the two apart, every GitHub/Bitbucket callback
   would 401 (orders never complete), and the outbound token — which is readable
   by any admin and shared to the CI system — could forge callbacks. Now both
   validate against `callback_secret`, matching GitLab.
   *Files:* `webhooks/github/workflow/route.ts`, `webhooks/bitbucket/pipeline/route.ts`.
   *Regression tests added* (distinct outbound/inbound secrets).

2. **`JWT_SECRET` silently fell back to `''`** — with no secret set, tokens were
   signed/verified with an empty key, letting anyone mint a `root` session.
   Now fails fast at module load if the secret is missing or < 32 chars, and
   `verifyToken` pins `algorithms: ['HS256']`.
   *File:* `lib/auth/jwt.ts`.

3. **Audit export was broken and leaked the token** — the frontend opened the
   export via `window.open(...&token=…)`, but the endpoint only authenticates via
   the `Authorization` header, so every export 401'd; the token was also placed
   in the URL (history/Referer/logs). Now fetched with the header and downloaded
   from the response blob.
   *File:* `audit/AuditTable.tsx`.

4. **CSV formula injection in audit export** — cells beginning with `= + - @`
   (tab/CR) are executed as formulas by Excel/Sheets. Audit fields capture
   user-supplied values. Such cells are now prefixed with `'`.
   *File:* `audit/export/route.ts`. *Regression test added.*

5. **Email header hardening** — subjects were HTML-escaped (wrong for plain-text
   subjects → double-escaped names) and relied on escaping for header safety.
   Subjects now use the raw product name with CR/LF stripped.
   *File:* `lib/notification/index.ts`.

### Correctness

6. **Race conditions in approve / reject / decommission** — all three read the
   row, checked its status, then triggered pipelines and updated non-atomically.
   Two concurrent calls (or a double-click) could both pass the check and
   double-provision / double-destroy, or leave an active infra element attached
   to a rejected order. Each now claims the row with a conditional
   `UPDATE … WHERE status = <expected> RETURNING` and rolls back on trigger
   failure, so only one caller can win the transition.
   *Files:* `services/approvals.ts`, `services/infrastructure.ts`.

7. **SMTP config changes never took effect** — the transporter/settings were
   cached at module scope and never invalidated, so admin-UI SMTP edits were
   ignored until restart. Added `resetSmtpCache()`, called on SMTP config update.
   *Files:* `lib/notification/index.ts`, `services/admin/config.ts`.

8. **AI endpoint default ignored the provider and blank values** — a blank
   endpoint (which the UI explicitly allows) never fell back because the column
   is a non-null `''`, and the single hardcoded default was an OpenAI host even
   for Claude. Blank now normalizes to a per-provider default, and a malformed
   AI JSON response throws a clear error instead of a raw `JSON.parse` crash.
   *File:* `lib/ai/index.ts`.

9. **AI-translate errors were swallowed in the UI** — the handler had an empty
   `catch`, so a failed translation silently stopped the spinner. Errors are now
   surfaced in a banner.
   *File:* `admin/products/[id]/ProductEditForm.tsx`.

10. **Decommission confirmation warning only shown in English** — a hardcoded
    English string replaced the existing localized `cannotBeUndone` key.
    *File:* `infrastructure/InfraActions.tsx`.

11. **Root `.env.example` was stale and misleading** — wrong var names
    (`SESSION_SECRET`, `ENTRA_REDIRECT_URL`, `SMTP_USERNAME/PASSWORD`), unused
    vars, missing required vars (`JWT_SECRET`, `FRONTEND_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`,
    `API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`), and a DB name that didn't match compose.
    Rewritten to match the code.
    *File:* `.env.example`.

## Deferred — confirmed findings needing a decision (not changed)

- **GitHub-backed orders never complete (HIGH).** `triggerGitHubWorkflow` returns
  a synthetic id `owner/repo/workflow@branch` (workflow_dispatch has no run id),
  but the callback stores the numeric `workflow_run.id`. They can never match in
  `handlePipelineEvent`, so GitHub orders stay `provisioning` forever. Proper fix
  requires correlating on a unique dispatch input (e.g. `ORDER_ID` echoed into
  the run) and can't be verified without a live GitHub — needs design + real
  testing. *File:* `lib/ci/github.ts`, `webhook/handler.ts`.

- **Multi-pipeline orders complete on the first success (HIGH).**
  `handlePipelineEvent` completes an order as soon as *any* pipeline in its array
  succeeds; a later failure is dropped. Needs per-pipeline status tracking.
  *File:* `lib/webhook/handler.ts`.

- **`createOrder` does no server-side parameter validation (MEDIUM).** Required
  params aren't enforced and types aren't coerced/validated against the
  `parameters` table before an order is accepted and sent to provisioning.
  *File:* `services/orders.ts`.

- **`createOrder` has no project-ownership check (MEDIUM / IDOR).** A PM can
  submit an order against another PM's `projectId`; the resulting infra element
  (and cost) is attributed to — and manageable by — the other owner. Needs an
  ownership check for non-admins. *File:* `services/orders.ts`.

- **Cascade delete races with in-flight destroy (MEDIUM).** `deleteProject` /
  `deleteProduct` fire-and-forget the destroy webhook then immediately delete the
  rows (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), losing tracking of the running decommission.
  *Files:* `services/projects.ts`, `services/admin/products.ts`.

- **Drizzle meta snapshots for migrations 0002–0004 are missing (HIGH for
  `db:generate`).** `meta/_journal.json` lists five migrations but only 0000/0001
  snapshots exist, and 0001 is stale. The runtime migrator is unaffected, but the
  next `drizzle-kit generate` will fail or emit a corrupt duplicate migration.
  Regenerate the snapshots with `drizzle-kit`. *Dir:* `drizzle/meta/`.

- **OAuth login flow (LOW–MEDIUM).** The Entra `id_token` is decoded but not
  verified (no JWKS/`aud`/`iss`), there's no `state`/`nonce` (login-CSRF), and
  the session JWT is delivered as a URL query param. Needs an auth-flow rework.
  *File:* `auth/callback/route.ts`.

- **Login rate-limit is bypassable (MEDIUM).** Keyed on the spoofable
  `X-Forwarded-For`; the in-memory bucket is also unbounded. Derive the IP from
  the trusted proxy hop and bound the map. *File:* `auth/login/route.ts`.

- **No pagination on CI provider listings (MEDIUM).** GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket
  repo/branch/file listings cap at 100 with no cursor follow, silently
  truncating large orgs. *Files:* `lib/ci/{gitlab,github,bitbucket}.ts`.

- **Test-setup schema drift (LOW–MEDIUM).** `src/test/setup.ts` gives
  `callback_secret`/`exchange_rates.rate` defaults prod lacks, and branding color
  defaults that differ from `schema.ts`. No live bug today (all insert paths
  supply the values), but it weakens the suite's ability to catch future prod
  drift. The branding default mismatch also needs a decision on the canonical
  color. *File:* `src/test/setup.ts`.

# Frontend Audit — Usability / Accessibility / Localization — 2026-08-12

Three focused audits of `apps/frontend/src` (React components, pages, i18n).
After changes: typecheck ✅, lint ✅, 20 frontend tests ✅.

## Fixed on this branch

### Accessibility

- **`<html lang>` hardcoded to `en`** despite 25 supported languages — screen
  readers announced every localized page in English. Root layout now derives it
  from `getLang()`. *File:* `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Form controls not linked to their error/hint text** — `Input`/`Select` now
  set `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` pointing at id'd error/hint nodes.
- **Table headers had no `scope`**, and clickable rows weren't keyboard-operable
  — added `scope="col"`, plus `role="button"`/`tabIndex`/Enter-Space handling and
  a focus ring when `onRowClick` is used. *File:* `components/ui/Table.tsx`.
- **Modal had no accessible name** — linked the `<h2>` via `aria-labelledby`.
- **Error toasts weren't announced assertively** — error toasts now use
  `role="alert"` (success/info stay `role="status"`); decorative icon hidden.
- **Global search input had no accessible name** — added `aria-label`.
  *File:* `components/layout/Header.tsx`.
- **Full-page loading spinner announced nothing** — added `role="status"`.
- **No skip-to-content link** — added one targeting `<main id="main">`.
- **LanguageSwitcher dropdown couldn't be closed with the keyboard** — added
  Escape-to-close.
- **Low-contrast meaningful text** (`text-slate-400` on white, ~2.5:1) — bumped
  to `text-slate-500` for the table empty state and catalog counts/empty text.

### Usability

- **False "Saved!" on a failed price save (HIGH)** — a per-environment pricing
  save swallowed the error and always showed "Saved!". It now propagates the
  failure and the row shows the error. *File:* `admin/products/[id]/ProductEditForm.tsx`.
- **Silent delete/toggle/load failures in admin managers** — cost-centers,
  parameters, ci-sources, users and categories managers swallowed errors, so a
  failed delete left the modal stuck with no feedback and a failed list-load was
  indistinguishable from an empty list. Each now surfaces the error in the delete
  modal and/or a card banner. Same fix for the webhook/pipeline-stack/parameter
  delete handlers in `ProductEditForm`.

### Localization

- **Prices formatted with a hardcoded `en` locale** — `convertPrice` now takes a
  `locale` and formats grouping/decimals accordingly (e.g. `1.234,56` for de);
  callers pass the active language. *Files:* `lib/locale.ts`, `catalog/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `components/forms/OrderForm.tsx`.
- **Dates rendered in the server/browser default locale** — passed the active
  `lang` to `toLocale*` on the six list/detail sites where `lang` was already in
  scope (orders, projects, audit, dashboard, approvals, infrastructure).

## Deferred — needs translation resources or a larger rework

- **The entire `admin/**` subtree is not internationalized (systemic, HIGH).** No
  admin file uses `t()` — every PageHeader, Card/Modal title, table header, form
  label/placeholder/hint, button, option array and error string is hardcoded
  English. Fixing it means adding ~100+ new keys **and translating them into all
  25 languages**; that needs real translation (the app already ships an
  AI-translate feature for product content that could be leveraged), not
  hand-fabricated strings. Not attempted blind.
- **`StatusBadge` labels are hardcoded English** (7 of 8 status keys don't exist)
  — shown on orders, infrastructure, approvals, dashboard. Needs 7 keys × 25
  languages. *File:* `components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx`.
- **Order-detail and project-detail pages are fully hardcoded** (many keys already
  exist and could be wired up; a few are new). `lang` also needs plumbing there,
  which is why their date formatting wasn't localized above.
- **Dashboard footer + imprint page hardcoded**; **OrderForm** concatenates a
  hardcoded English sentence onto a translated string.
- **Hardcoded a11y labels** (`Modal` "Close", `Toast` "Dismiss", `Header` search
  button "Search", skip link) — English literals pending translation keys.
- **SSR/first-paint language flash** — `TopNav` and `(dashboard)/error.tsx` call
  `useLang()` with no server-provided initial value, so nav/error text renders in
  English until hydration. Thread the server `lang` in as the initial value.
- **Remaining usability polish**: audit filters aren't debounced (a request per
  keystroke); several managers lack success toasts for consistency; server list
  pages (orders/projects/catalog) swallow fetch errors and render as empty rather
  than routing to the error boundary; `EnvironmentsManager` uses a native
  `confirm()` for callback-secret regeneration (inconsistent with the app's modal
  pattern) and copy has no "Copied" feedback.
- **`Sidebar.tsx` is dead code** (not imported anywhere) and is fully hardcoded —
  delete it or translate it if it will be used.

# Deferred-Items Follow-up — 2026-08-12

Applied the remaining deferred fixes that were safe and verifiable, and added
regression tests. After this round: **743 backend tests** (+21) and **51 frontend
tests** (+31, from 20), typecheck + lint clean across both apps. Test
recommendations at all levels are in `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`.

## Now fixed

### Backend
- **createOrder server-side validation + ownership (IDOR).** Loads the applicable
  parameter definitions (shared `loadApplicableParameters` in `catalog.ts`) and
  rejects missing-required / bad-typed params (400); a PM ordering into a project
  they don't own → 403; a product not offered in the chosen environment → 400.
- **Multi-pipeline order completion.** New `pipeline_status` JSONB column
  (migration `0005`) tracks per-pipeline status; an order completes only when all
  its pipelines succeed and fails if any fails.
- **Login rate-limit bypass.** `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted only when
  `TRUST_PROXY` is set; the attempts map is now bounded.
- **CI listing pagination.** GitLab/GitHub/Bitbucket list calls follow next-page
  cursors (capped at 10 pages).
- **Cascade-delete race.** `deleteProject`/`deleteProduct` await the destroy
  trigger before deleting so cascaded infra rows aren't removed mid-destroy.

### Frontend
- **StatusBadge i18n** (7 new status keys × 25 languages) — status labels now
  localize everywhere they appear.
- **SSR language flash** fixed for `TopNav` (server lang threaded in).
- **Audit filters debounced** (300ms) — no request per keystroke.
- **Server list pages** (orders/projects/catalog) surface fetch failures (error
  boundary / explicit error state) instead of a misleading empty state.
- **EnvironmentsManager** replaces native `confirm()` with the app's Modal, adds
  error handling and a "Copied" confirmation.
- **Order-detail, project-detail, footer, and imprint** pages internationalized
  (existing + new keys) with locale-aware dates.

### Tests added
- Backend: +21 regression tests (order validation/ownership, multi-pipeline,
  rate-limit spoofing, CI pagination, cascade ordering).
- Frontend: +31 tests — new component tests for `Input`, `Select`, `Table`,
  `Modal`, `Toast`, `StatusBadge`, plus `AuditTable` debounce, and lib tests for
  `i18n` (key/lang completeness + fallback) and `locale` (conversion + locale
  formatting).

## Still deferred (with reasons)

- **Full `admin/**` CRUD form/manager i18n.** StatusBadge, detail pages, footer
  and imprint are done, but the admin create/edit/delete forms and manager
  headers remain hardcoded English — ~100 strings needing accurate translation
  into all 25 languages. This should be driven through the app's own AI-translate
  pipeline rather than hand-fabricated; not attempted blind.
- **Drizzle meta snapshots (0002–0005) — intentionally NOT regenerated.** The six
  SQL migrations are already applied to real databases (tracked by hash), so
  rewriting migration history would break deployed environments, and hand-writing
  accurate drizzle v7 snapshots for the manual migrations is error-prone. The
  runtime migrator (`readMigrationFiles`) is unaffected; only `drizzle-kit
  generate` is impacted. Fix in a dedicated effort: regenerate the snapshot chain
  with drizzle-kit and verify against a fresh DB before relying on `db:generate`.
- **GitHub workflow-run ID correlation** — needs a design decision (correlate via
  a unique dispatch input / run-name) and live-GitHub testing.
- **OAuth hardening** (id_token signature/`aud`/`iss` verification, `state`/`nonce`,
  moving the session JWT out of the callback URL) — a larger auth-flow rework.
- **`error.tsx` SSR language** — left as a `// TODO(i18n)` (an error boundary has
  no server-resolved lang; a synchronous cookie read risks a hydration mismatch).
- **Dropdown option-list validation** — the `parameters` table stores no allowed-
  options column, so dropdown values can't be constrained server-side yet.

/**
 * Accessibility gate.
 *
 * WCAG 2.1 A + AA across every page a user can reach, plus the AAA criteria this
 * app can actually honour, plus the dialog states — this app puts most of its
 * forms inside <dialog>, and a static scan never opens them, which is how six
 * admin modals went unchecked.
 *
 * Three things this suite deliberately does NOT rely on:
 *
 *  1. Default branding. The header, nav, hero and footer are painted on the
 *     operator's chosen colour. Hardcoded white text passed with the shipped
 *     dark default and collapsed to 1.88:1 on a mid-tone amber, so the contrast
 *     check runs against a deliberately hostile colour as well. See
 *     apps/frontend/src/lib/contrast.ts.
 *  2. axe alone. Focus visibility, target size, accessible-name language and
 *     the contrast of glyph-only text are not things axe can test at the level
 *     this app claims, so they get explicit assertions of their own. The last of
 *     those is not a gap axe could close by configuration — see `glyphContrast`.
 *  3. "AAA" as a slogan. Full AAA is not reachable for an app whose brand colour
 *     is chosen by the operator, so the AAA claim here is partial and the parts
 *     that were refused are written down — with the arithmetic — in
 *     docs/guides/accessibility.md. Read that before adding or removing a tag.

/**
 * The tags requested from axe.
 *
 * The AAA tags earn exactly three rules — axe has no others — and all three ship
 * `enabled: false`. Naming a tag explicitly runs them anyway: axe's `matchTags`
 * only consults `rule.enabled` when the include list is empty. wcag21aaa and
 * wcag22aaa match nothing today; they are here so a future axe release that adds
 * an AAA rule is picked up rather than silently skipped.
 *
 * `best-practice` is the newest of them, and it is worth 30 rules. Enumerated
 * against the axe-core 4.13.0 this repo pins, 30 of its 105 rules carry
 * `best-practice` and no `wcagNNN` tag at all, so the five WCAG tags above asked
 * for none of them (#185). They are not a softer class of finding — they are the
 * structural checks nothing else here performs: `heading-order`,
 * `page-has-heading-one`, `empty-heading`, `region`, `landmark-one-main`,
 * `landmark-unique`, the three `landmark-no-duplicate-*`, `skip-link`,
 * `tabindex`, `empty-table-header`. Between them, on the first run, they found
 * that `/` and `/catalog` had no `<h1>`, that /login and an unconfigured
 * /impressum had no landmark at all, and that every page built from
 * `PageHeader` + `Card` went h1 → h3 because `Card` hardcoded its title's
 * level.
 *
 * Three rules axe ships are still not requested, and all three deliberately:
 * `duplicate-id` and `duplicate-id-active` are tagged `deprecated` and
 * `wcag2a-obsolete` (4.1.1 was removed from WCAG in 2.2), and `target-size` is
 * the WCAG 2.2 AA criterion 2.5.8 at 24px — a weaker claim than the 44px 2.5.5
 * this suite measures itself further down, so passing it would say nothing.
 *
 * `the gate asks axe for the best-practice rules` below holds this honest: a tag
 * that stops matching is a silently smaller gate, not a red one.

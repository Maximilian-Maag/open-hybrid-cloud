/**
 * What each role may do, checked as that role.
 *
 * ── Why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every other spec in this suite signs in as root. That is one account, holding
 * the highest of three ranks, and it cannot see a permission bug by
 * construction — so the suite had no coverage at all of the two roles that do
 * the actual work.
 *
 * What it cost: `GET /api/admin/categories` was gated on `root` while the
 * catalogue page fetched it, in the same `Promise.all` as the products, to build
 * its category filter. Every project manager and every admin got a 403 there,
 * the rejection took the products down with it, and the shop rendered as an
 * error page. For everyone except root. Thirty assertions in `catalog.spec.ts`
 * stayed green the whole time, because the one account they run as was the one
 * account for which the page worked. The operator found it by creating a project
 * manager by hand.
 *
 * ── The two halves ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ENDPOINTS` is the permission matrix, taken from the `requireAuth` /
 * `requireRole` call in each backend route handler, and asserted through the
 * proxy with each role's own session. It is the half that would have caught the
 * bug above in one line, and it is cheap: one request per cell, no page loads.
 *
 * `PAGES` is reachability — every screen a role's navigation offers it must
 * actually render, with its data, as that role. A 403 on a page's data does not
 * have to look like an error page (the product detail page degrades to a missing
 * breadcrumb), so the endpoint half cannot replace this one.
 *
 * ── Keeping it honest ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When a route's guard changes, its row here has to change with it, and the row
 * is the assertion — a table nobody updates is a table that passes. The
 * `expected` field is written as the roles that ARE allowed rather than a
 * minimum rank, so a row cannot silently widen when the rank order is edited.

 * it, the role that is deliberately outside the approval workflow could still
 * enumerate every active admin through that endpoint.
 *
 * This row is the reason the table is written as the set of roles that ARE
 * allowed rather than as a minimum rank. A minimum-rank model cannot represent
